              anxiety associated with depression. Peppermint tea is rich in antioxidants, there are lots of other benefits of peppermint tea too -

              Peppermint thrives in most soil types, in sun or light shade, and usually forms large leafy clumps up to 1m 
             (3.3ft) tall and wide. Most mints are vigorous, spreading plants, so are best grown in large pots or in bottomless buckets 
             sunk into the ground, to keep their roots contained.The best time to harvest mint leaves is right before flowers appear, usually midway through
              the growing season. However, you can start collecting individual leaves as soon as the plants reach at least 4 inches in height. For fresh use,
               pick green leaves from the plant as required.

                    The best time to pick them is after the first frost, then you really get the sweetness that they stow away to burst forth
                    for a relatively small window in the late fall. You can pick them before the frost, just make sure they are nice and red, if you
                    want to sweeten them up just pop them in the freezer.

                  immune system. Herbalists use dandelion root to detoxify the liver and gallbladder, and dandelion leaves to help kidney function.Dandelions contain 
                  beta-carotene, which is an antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage. Research shows that carotenoids such as beta-carotene play a vital role 
                  in reducing cell damage. The flower of the dandelion is also full of flavonoids and polyphenols, which are other types of antioxidants. Dandelions 
                  have amazing skin care benefits: They're rich in antioxidants, have anti-aging qualities, and can help protect the skin against UV damage. Dandelions

                   Dandelion greens turn bitter and woody quite quickly, so very early spring is the best time to harvest them. To harvest and eat dandelions, try to clip 
                   the small leaves from the plant before the plant flowers.

                  For growing aloe indoors, place in bright, indirect sunlight. For growing outdoors, ensure aloe is lightly shaded to protect it during the hottest 
                  times of the day. Covered patios and porches are great places to grow aloe during warm seasons. Plant in fast-draining Miracle-Gro Cactus, Palm & 
                  Citrus Potting Mix. The ingredients of the gel-like plant juice have a widely proven positive effect on our skin. If you want to harvest Aloe vera,
                   it is best to use two- to three-year-old plants and cut the leaves at the base of the stems with a clean, sharp knife.

                  <p>Choose a sunny planting site for best results. Raspberries will fruit in light shade, but will produce a 
                  smaller crop and be less robust and healthy. Raspberries are usually grown in rows, ideally running north to south so the plants don't shade
                   each other. The leaves are best harvested in the spring before the flowers emerge. Choose young, bright green leaves. Since the leaves shrink
                    down quite a bit after they are dried, harvest more than you think you'll need. Start with at least a couple handfuls

                  sap to make syrup. Birch buds have long been known to have healing properties. They treat diseases of the stomach and duodenum, and relieve inflammatory 
                  processes in the lungs and liver. Birch buds improve appetite. And birch water is also a source of Vitamin C, an antioxidant that stimulates collagen
