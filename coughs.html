              <p>Iceland moss is used for treating <b> of the mouth and throat, loss of appetite, common cold, dry cough, 
                bronchitis, indigestion, fevers, lung disease, kidney and bladder complaints, and the tendency toward infection.</b>

                 Even though mosses are known for thriving in harsh environments, they still need a lot of water, above-zero temperatures 
                 and sunlight in order to grow and expand. If it's too cold or too dry, they stay dormant and wait for better living conditions.

                Both the leaves and branches can be used to <b>treat sprains, strained muscles and headaches, and steaming the leaves can help clear sinus
                congestion. In the early spring, the buds of the birch can be infused in oil to make a topical salve for inflamed skin.</b> Birch trees can 
                also be tapped for their sap to make syrup. Birch buds have long been known to have healing properties. They treat diseases of the <b>stomach
                and duodenum, and relieve inflammatory processes in the lungs and liver.</b> Birch buds improve appetite. And birch water is also a source of 
                Vitamin C, an antioxidant that stimulates collagen production and protects the body from UV rays. Sailors historically drank birch water to 
                ward off scurvy, a Vitamin C deficiency that causes weakness, bleeding from the skin and gum disease.

                Popular in European folk medicine, yarrow contains flavonoids, plant-based chemicals that <b>increase saliva and stomach acid to help improve digestion. 
                Yarrow may also relax smooth muscle in the intestine and uterus, which can relieve stomach and menstrual cramps.</b> Achillea millefolium (Yarrow) is a herbaceous 
                plant of Greek origin noted to <b>treat pneumonia, common cold, cough, and other respiratory disorders.</b> The flowers and leaves are the core part used to prepare 
                herbal tea that gains the world's recognition as medicinal tea. <b> A tea made from the leaves was used for fevers and colds.</b> The leaves can be crushed in your hand,
                mixed with water, and put on a sunburn. As a tea, Yarrow can be used to treat cold and flu-like symptoms, <b>as well as mouth pain including phlegm, sore throat, inflamed
                gums or toothaches. Yarrow also aid in digestion, lowers blood pressure increases circulation, regulates menstrual cycle and eliminates excess water
                from the body (like diuretic). </b>

                The plant should look healthy, with the flowers completely or mostly open. It's okay if the lower leaves are dying back, but the upper 
                leaves and blossoms should appear fresh. When making teas and tinctures to be taken internally, typically the flowering tops (leaves, stems, and flowers) are used.
