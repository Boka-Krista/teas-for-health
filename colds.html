                                <img style="border: 5px outset green" src="assets/images/vigrieze.jpeg" alt="Meadowsweet" float="left">

                            <p>Meadowsweet is used for colds, bronchitis, upset stomach, 
                                heartburn, peptic ulcer disease, and joint disorders including gout. 
                                It is also used to increase urine output and kill germs in the urine
                                 of people with bladder infections. It has antispasmodic and calming properties. 
                                 This beautiful plant can help relieve menstrual cramps and period pain. It can 
                                 also be used to relieve anxiety and promote sleep. Who should not take meadowsweet?
                                 Pregnancy: It is likely unsafe to use meadowsweet while pregnant. It might make the 
                                 uterus contract, causing a miscarriage. Breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information
                                  to know if meadowsweet is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
                                  Most herbalists recommend that if you're new to meadowsweet that you begin by drinking small
                                  amounts of tea made with this herb. The most common way to use the dried flowers and fresh roots
                                   for their medicinal properties is to make herbal meadowsweet tea.
                                  If you want to grow it in your own garden, all you need is a spot in full sun with rich, moist soil.
                                  End of June and July are the busiest harvesting times for a medicinal herb farmer.

                            <p>
                                Iceland moss is used for treating irritation of the mouth and throat, loss of appetite, common cold, dry cough, 
                                bronchitis, indigestion, fevers, lung disease, kidney and bladder complaints, and the tendency toward infection.
                                 Even though mosses are known for thriving in harsh environments, they still need a lot of water, above-zero temperatures 
                                 and sunlight in order to grow and expand. If it's too cold or too dry, they stay dormant and wait for better living conditions.

                                Raspberry leaves are often used to treat symptoms of cold, as it has properties to reduce fever, related pain. 
                                Red raspberry leaf has been recommended as a tonic to improve fat metabolism and encourage weight loss. It is 
                                often sold as a “detoxifying” supplement meant to improve body composition and overall health. Red raspberry leaf 
                                tea has been used for centuries as a traditional remedy for various health purposes, particularly for women’s reproductive health. 
                                The tea is rich in vitamins, minerals and plant compounds, including tannins and flavonoids. It’s known for its high content of 
                                vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin A, calcium, iron, potassium and magnesium.
                                Often associated with pregnancy and childbirth, red raspberry leaf tea is believed to help with toning the uterus, strengthening
                                 the pelvic muscles and promoting smoother labor. Some women drink red raspberry leaf tea in the later stages of pregnancy to help 
                                 prepare their bodies for childbirth.
                                Additionally, red raspberry leaf tea is consumed for several other potential health benefits. It’s used as a mild tonic for supporting 
                                overall well-being, promoting healthy digestion and alleviating menstrual discomfort. The tea is also used for its potential antioxidant 
                                and anti-inflammatory properties.Choose a sunny planting site for best results. Raspberries will fruit in light shade, but will produce a 
                                smaller crop and be less robust and healthy. Raspberries are usually grown in rows, ideally running north to south so the plants don't shade
                                 each other. The leaves are best harvested in the spring before the flowers emerge. Choose young, bright green leaves. Since the leaves shrink
                                  down quite a bit after they are dried, harvest more than you think you'll need. Start with at least a couple handfuls

                            <a href="assets/images/rosehip.jpeg">

                            </a>
                            <p> 
                                Rosehip tea is renowned for its potential health benefits, including its ability to: Boost Immunity: The high 
                                vitamin C content in rosehip tea can help prevent and alleviate colds and flu. Joint Health: Rosehip tea may offer 
                                relief from joint pain and stiffness, making it a natural remedy for arthritis sufferers.Improving digestion: Rose hips 
                                contain pectin, a type of fiber that can help to improve digestion and reduce constipation. Reducing stress and anxiety: Some 
                                people claim that drinking rose hip tea can help to reduce stress and anxiety, although more research is needed to confirm this 
                                effect. The best time to pick them is after the first frost, then you really get the sweetness that they stow away to burst forth
                                 for a relatively small window in the late fall. You can pick them before the frost, just make sure they are nice and red, if you
                                  want to sweeten them up just pop them in the freezer.

                                  serving of blood-building iron, as well as plenty of eye-protective vitamin A and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), which may boost the effectiveness of the human immune

                                Linden flowers are sometimes suggested to treat colds, cough, fever, infections, inflammation, high blood pressure, headache 
                                (particularly migraine); as a diuretic (increases urine production), antispasmodic (reduces smooth muscle spasm along the digestive tract), 
                                and sedative.Linden is a common name for trees belonging to the Tilia genus. The dried flower, leaves, and wood are used for medicine. 
                                People use linden for conditions such as colds, headache, trouble sleeping (insomnia), itchy skin, and many others, but there is no good
                                 scientific evidence to support these uses.Linden trees typically bloom between June and July and once they are in full bloom, it is best 
                                 to harvest the flowers within the first 4 days. Remember that the large-leaved linden flowers a little earlier than the small-leaved linden does.
