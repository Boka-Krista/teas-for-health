                  carbohydrates to give you energy. Soluble fibre helps to slow down the release of nutrients, particularly glucose, into the blood stream,
                  which is healthier for the body. Find yourself slumping at your desk mid-afternoon? Try swapping your energy drink for a fruity blackcurrant tea.

                  accuracy while under significant mental stress. Black currant doesn't only tastes great, it may offer many great health benefits such as regulating blood 
                  pressure, increasing fat oxidation and promoting skin health. A black currant is a diminutive fruit that packs a big nutritional punch in a small package.

                  A cup of tea made with this vibrant ingredient delivers a generous serving of vitamin C that may stave off colds and infections. Black currant also provides a 
                  serving of blood-building iron, as well as plenty of eye-protective vitamin A and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), which may boost the effectiveness of the human immune 
                  system.

                    Peppermint thrives in most soil types, in sun or light shade, and usually forms large leafy clumps up to 1m 
                   (3.3ft) tall and wide. Most mints are vigorous, spreading plants, so are best grown in large pots or in bottomless buckets 
                   sunk into the ground, to keep their roots contained.The best time to harvest mint leaves is right before flowers appear, usually midway through
                    the growing season. However, you can start collecting individual leaves as soon as the plants reach at least 4 inches in height. For fresh use,
                     pick green leaves from the plant as required.

                           Rosemary is a large, shrubby herb that is normally grown outdoors, but potted plants can be grown
                         indoors if you give them some special tending and attention. Rosemary thrives on lots of light and a precise watering cadence that ensures its loamy soil stays
                         well-hydrated without getting waterlogged.

                        Both animal and human studies have found that curcumin (turmeric is a plant and it's the roots of the plant that are used to make the spice that is used in 
                        cooking and herbal drinks. Curcumin is the naturally occurring compound within the plant's roots that give it it's bright yellow colour and is known as a

                        reversing many brain diseases and age-related decreases in brain function. It may also help improve memory and attention, which seems logical given its 
                        effects on BDNF levels. It contains an active compound, curcumin, that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Research has found that curcumin has the 
                        potential to improve a number of health conditions — including depression. This includes mild depression and even major depressive disorder (MDD). Today, turmeric
                         is promoted as a dietary supplement for a variety of conditions, including arthritis, digestive disorders, respiratory infections, allergies, liver disease,
                          and many others.

                             With the unpredictable nature of UK weather, we recommend growing turmeric 
                          root indoors as it will not survive if temperatures drop below 10°C. If you're planting them inside, then they won't need any light until you start seeing 
                          some sprouts, so don't worry about natural light for the first few months.
